          <span>
            I am just a dude from Bangalore who wants to do something special
            with his life, maybe make the world a better place. I like solving
            problems and that's why I chose Computer Science for my Bachelor of
            Technology degree. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are
            the most interesting to me, because, like, how can a computer even
            do this stuff? I actually like studying, not the way school teaches,
            but when you actually study to learn something you love. I love
            playing sports, mainly basketball. Some of my hobbies are investing
            in stocks, playing video games, and drawing.

            My ideal life would be one where I could travel the world non-stop,
            staying a month or 2 in each place, while coding and investing on
            the go. As long as I like the problems I keep trying to solve, I'll
            do any job. I don't want to waste more time doing higher education
            because it's a scam, honestly, especially in this day and age with
            the internet. I would love to build something as amazing as the
            internet. I hope opportunity comes calling.
